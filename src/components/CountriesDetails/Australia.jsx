          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Australia's world-class universities and excellent educational system make it a popular choice for overseas students seeking higher education. However, the cost of attending an Australian university varies according to the school and subject selected. undergraduate course fees usually range between 12,000 and 15,000 AUD each semester.

            In addition to paying tuition, overseas students must cover living expenses such as housing, food, and transportation. Also, the average annual living expenditure for overseas students studying in Australia is estimated to be 21,041 AUD. Furthermore, students might also need to budget for travel expenditures, which can run up to $2,200 AUD.

            However, the ability for overseas students to work up to 24 hours a week as a part-time employee is one benefit of studying in Australia. They can obtain work experience and use it to help pay for their housing and travel expenses.

            International students who choose to stay in Australia after finishing their studies have access to great post-study employment possibilities.

            Therefore, in a comparable manner, graduates of Master's programs are eligible to apply for a three- to five-year-long PSW visa. Moreover, with the help of these PSW visas, overseas students can grow their careers in Australia, make money, and obtain useful job experience. Australia is a popular location for overseas students who want to pursue higher education and further their careers because of the post-study job options there.          </p>
