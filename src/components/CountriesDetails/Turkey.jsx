          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How Much Does It Cost to Study In Turkey?</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Turkey offers exceptional value for international students seeking quality education at affordable costs. Public universities charge annual tuition fees ranging from $200 to $2,500 for undergraduate programs, while private universities typically charge between $5,000 to $20,000 annually depending on the program and institution. Medical programs at private universities can cost up to $25,000 per year, which is still significantly lower than similar programs in Western countries.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Living expenses in Turkey are remarkably affordable compared to European and North American countries. Students can expect to spend approximately $300-$500 per month on living costs, including accommodation, food, transportation, and entertainment. Major cities like Istanbul may be slightly more expensive, while smaller cities like Ankara, Izmir, and Antalya offer even lower living costs. Student dormitories and shared apartments are widely available and very affordable, typically costing between $100-$250 per month.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            International students with a valid student residence permit are allowed to work part-time up to 24 hours per week during the academic year. This provides an excellent opportunity to gain work experience, practice Turkish or English, and earn money to support living expenses. Many students find work in cafes, restaurants, tutoring, or translation services.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Scholarships For International Students In Turkey</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Turkey offers one of the most generous scholarship programs in the world through the Türkiye Scholarships (formerly Turkey Burslari). This government-funded program provides full scholarships to thousands of international students annually, covering tuition fees, accommodation, health insurance, monthly stipend, and even Turkish language courses. The scholarship is highly competitive and open to students from all countries for undergraduate, master's, and doctoral programs.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            In addition to Türkiye Scholarships, many Turkish universities offer their own merit-based scholarships ranging from 25% to 100% tuition waivers. Some universities also provide accommodation scholarships or reduced fees for international students. Private foundations, such as the Ibn Haldun University Foundation and various charitable organizations, also offer scholarships to deserving students. Our consultancy can guide you through the entire scholarship application process to maximize your chances of securing funding for your studies in Turkey.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Turkey offers excellent post-study work opportunities for international graduates.

Graduates from Turkish universities have an advantage in the Turkish job market, especially in sectors like IT, engineering, tourism, education, and international business.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Turkey's rapidly growing economy, with major international companies establishing regional headquarters in Istanbul and other cities, creates numerous job opportunities for qualified graduates. The country's strategic location makes it an attractive hub for international trade, finance, and technology sectors. Additionally, graduates who work in Turkey for a specified period can eventually apply for permanent residence and citizenship under certain conditions.
